## Overview

### Quickstart

1.  First, let's kick the tyres by launching the sample _Repospective_ app
    bundled with this project to demo some of its best features:

    ```Shell
    npm run setup && npm start
    ```

1.  Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

    - Add a Github username to see Redux and Redux Sagas in action: effortless
      async state updates and side effects are now yours :)
    - Edit the file at `./src/components/Header/index.jsx` so that the text of
      the `<Button>` component reads "Features!!!"... [Hot Module Reloading](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/) gives
      you a feedback loop with your UI so smooth it's almost conversational!
    - Click your (newly emphatic) Features button to see React Router in action...
      Now you can share a direct link to that content privately over your LAN or
      globally addressable to any device, anywhere. Not bad for a locally-running
      Single Page App.

1.  Time to build your own app: run

    ```shell
    npm run clean
    ```

    ...and use the built-in generators to start your first feature.
